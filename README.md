# Health-Tracking-Application

About the Application:
This Apllication was created by me and my fellow peers enrolled for a Human Computer Interaction Course. The motivation behind this application was to  
introduce a goal point streak as an attempt for users to keep up with their daily health and nutritional requirements.

##General Application Instructions

1.Navigate between the different screens of the app using the "Menu" button in the top-left.

2.Edit data for any day by editing the fields in the default "Input Daily Data" screen. Control the date you are editing using the buttons at the top.

3.Adjust the goals for the current day forward, or add and remove the choices for food groups using the Goals & Settings screen.

4.View visualizations of historical data in the "View History" screen. Set the scale for the graphs with the buttons in the top-right corner, and set the origin point of the graphs using the date control buttons at the top.

5.Each time the program is started or refreshed, it will randomly generate historical data for the last 2016 days, up to and including today.
